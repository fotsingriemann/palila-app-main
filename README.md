## About The Project

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/docs/preview.gif">
</p>

This app was written to learn the characteristics of the menstrual cycle and design possible algorithms to help keep track of it.

The key questions this app aims to answer are:

- When is my next menstruation?
- What is the chance of getting pregnant right now?

The app offers even more **features**:

- Data is stored locally (not in the cloud).
- Export and import data
- Cycle length estimation
- Period length estimation
- Symptom tracking
- Prediction of next 3 periods
- Predictions of PMS
